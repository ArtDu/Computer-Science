a	Fear no more the heat o' the sun;
b	Nor the furious winter's rages,
c	Thou thy worldly task hast done,
d	Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages;
e	Golden lads and girls all must,
f	As chimney sweepers come to dust.
fer	Fear no more the frown of the great,
ge	Thou art past the tyrant's stroke:
y	Care no more to clothe and eat;
yp	To thee the reed is as the oak:
z	The sceptre, learning, physic, must
zz	All follow this, and come to dust.
